Here's an improved version of the code with performance and style enhancements:

1. **Reduce Repeated Service Calls**: Combine similar checks to minimize redundant operations.
2. **Use Early Returns**: Simplify logic flow and reduce nesting.
3. **Improve Log Messages**: Make them more informative.
4. **Meaningful Variable Names**: Enhance readability.

```csharp
static async Task RemoveUserFromM365Group(GraphServiceClient graphClient, string userMail, string groupMail, bool removeAsOwner, Config config)
{
    try
    {
        var userObj = await FetchUser(graphClient, userMail);
        var group = await FetchGroup(graphClient, groupMail);

        if (userObj == null || group == null)
        {
            Utility.Log($"User or group not found: {userMail}, {groupMail}");
            return;
        }

        bool isOwner = await IsUserExistInM365Group(graphClient, group.Id, userObj, true);
        bool isMember = await IsUserExistInM365Group(graphClient, group.Id, userObj, false);

        if (removeAsOwner && isOwner)
        {
            await graphClient.Groups[group.Id].Owners[userObj.Id].Ref.DeleteAsync();
            Utility.Log($"Removed {userMail} as owner from group: {groupMail}");
            return;
        }

        if (isMember)
        {
            await graphClient.Groups[group.Id].Members[userObj.Id].Ref.DeleteAsync();
            Utility.Log($"Removed {userMail} as member from group: {groupMail}");
            return;
        }

        Utility.Log($"{userMail} does not belong to group: {groupMail}");
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        Utility.Log($"Exception encountered: {ex.Message}");
        if (ex.InnerException != null)
            Utility.Log($"Inner Exception: {ex.InnerException.Message}");
    }
}
```

### Key Improvements:

- **Early Returns**: Immediately returns after a successful operation to avoid unnecessary checks.
- **Consolidated Checks**: Checks for ownership and membership are combined logically to prevent repeated service calls.
- **Enhanced Logging**: Provides clear and concise log messages for each operation.
- **Null Check Simplification**: Combines user and group null checks for efficiency.

These changes should make the code more efficient and easier to read.

To publish a React application to a QA environment, you typically need to create a build optimized for production and deploy it to the appropriate QA server. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to set up and publish your React app to a QA environment.

### 1. **Prepare for QA Environment**
You’ll need a specific configuration for the QA environment that might include environment-specific variables like API endpoints, authentication settings, and more.

#### Step 1: **Create Environment Variables**
React supports environment variables through `.env` files. You can create an environment file for QA, such as `.env.qa`.

In your project root, create the following file:

**`.env.qa`**:
```bash
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://qa.api.example.com
REACT_APP_ENV=qa
```

Make sure that the variables start with `REACT_APP_`, as React will only expose these to the application. You can add any other QA-specific environment variables here.

#### Step 2: **Modify `package.json` for QA Build**
Update the `package.json` to include a custom script for building the QA environment.

In the `scripts` section of `package.json`, add:
```json
"scripts": {
  "build": "react-scripts build",
  "build:qa": "env-cmd -f .env.qa react-scripts build"
}
```

**Note**: If `env-cmd` isn't installed, you can install it via npm:
```bash
npm install env-cmd --save-dev
```

### 2. **Build the React Application for QA**

To build the application for QA, run the following command:

```bash
npm run build:qa
```

This will create a production-ready build optimized for the QA environment and use the variables from `.env.qa`.

The build files will be generated in the `build` directory, which you can then deploy to your QA server.

### 3. **Deploy the Build to the QA Server**
There are multiple ways to deploy the React app to the QA server. Here are some common methods:

#### Option 1: **Using a Static File Server**
If you’re deploying to a static file server (e.g., Nginx, Apache), you need to:

1. **Copy the Build Folder**
   After building the React app, copy the `build` folder to the QA server.
   
2. **Configure the Server**
   Configure the web server to serve the files. For example, for Nginx, add the following configuration:

   **Nginx Config**:
   ```nginx
   server {
       listen 80;
       server_name qa.example.com;

       location / {
           root /path/to/build;
           try_files $uri /index.html;
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Restart the Server**
   After configuring the server, restart it to apply the changes.

#### Option 2: **Using a Cloud Service (e.g., AWS, Azure, Netlify, Vercel)**

If you're using cloud services like AWS, Netlify, or Vercel, follow these steps:

1. **Upload the Build Folder**
   Deploy the contents of the `build` folder to your chosen platform. For example:
   - **AWS S3**: Upload the `build` folder to an S3 bucket and configure it to serve as a static website.
   - **Netlify**: Drag and drop the `build` folder into the Netlify dashboard or use `netlify-cli` for deployment.
   - **Vercel**: Deploy by connecting your repository or uploading the `build` folder manually.

2. **Configure the QA Environment**
   Make sure the platform is using the correct environment variables for the QA environment. Most platforms allow you to set environment variables directly in their dashboard.

### 4. **QA Environment Testing**
Once the application is deployed to the QA environment, you can verify that it's using the correct environment settings.

- Check the `REACT_APP_API_URL` by opening the browser console and verifying that the API requests are pointing to the QA API.
- Ensure that any other environment-specific settings are correctly applied (e.g., authentication, services, etc.).

### 5. **Automating the Deployment (Optional)**
To streamline the process, consider setting up a CI/CD pipeline to automatically build and deploy to your QA environment whenever changes are pushed to the `qa` branch or any branch associated with QA testing.

Platforms like **GitHub Actions**, **GitLab CI**, **CircleCI**, or **Jenkins** can automate this process.

### Example GitHub Action for Deployment:
```yaml
name: Deploy to QA

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - qa

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
      - name: Build for QA
        run: npm run build:qa
      - name: Deploy to QA server
        run: scp -r build/* user@qa-server:/path/to/qa
```

This setup will trigger the build and deployment process whenever there is a push to the `qa` branch.

### Conclusion
By following these steps, you can build and publish your React app to the QA environment with the proper environment-specific settings. Depending on your infrastructure, the deployment process might vary, but the core steps for building and deploying the app remain the same.








To implement **NLog** in a .NET Core 8.0 solution, follow these detailed steps:

### 1. **Install NLog Packages**
   - Open your **.NET Core 8.0** solution in **Visual Studio 2022**.
   - Right-click on your project in **Solution Explorer** and choose **Manage NuGet Packages**.
   - Search for and install the following NuGet packages:
     - `NLog`
     - `NLog.Web.AspNetCore`

### 2. **Configure NLog Configuration File (nlog.config)**
   - Add an `nlog.config` file to your project root:
     1. Right-click your project, select **Add > New Item**.
     2. Choose **Text File** and name it `nlog.config`.
     3. Set the file to **Copy to Output Directory** by right-clicking the file, selecting **Properties**, and setting **Copy to Output Directory** to **Copy if newer**.

   - Define your log rules and targets inside `nlog.config`:

     ```xml
     <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
     <nlog xmlns="http://www.nlog-project.org/schemas/NLog.xsd"
           xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
           autoReload="true" internalLogLevel="Warn" internalLogFile="internal-nlog.txt">
       <targets>
         <!-- File target -->
         <target name="file" xsi:type="File" fileName="logs/logfile-${shortdate}.log"
                 layout="${longdate}|${level:uppercase=true}|${logger}|${message}|${exception}" />
         <!-- Console target -->
         <target name="console" xsi:type="Console" />
       </targets>

       <rules>
         <!-- Write all logs to file and console -->
         <logger name="*" minlevel="Info" writeTo="file,console" />
       </rules>
     </nlog>
     ```

### 3. **Configure NLog in `Program.cs`**
   Modify your `Program.cs` to configure **NLog** as the logging provider:
   
   ```csharp
   using NLog;
   using NLog.Web;

   public class Program
   {
       public static void Main(string[] args)
       {
           var logger = NLogBuilder.ConfigureNLog("nlog.config").GetCurrentClassLogger();
           try
           {
               logger.Info("Starting application...");
               var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

               // Add services to the container.
               builder.Logging.ClearProviders();  // Clears the default logging providers
               builder.Logging.SetMinimumLevel(Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.LogLevel.Trace);
               builder.Host.UseNLog();  // Use NLog as the logging provider

               var app = builder.Build();

               // Configure the HTTP request pipeline.
               if (app.Environment.IsDevelopment())
               {
                   app.UseSwagger();
                   app.UseSwaggerUI();
               }

               app.UseHttpsRedirection();
               app.UseAuthorization();

               app.MapControllers();

               app.Run();
           }
           catch (Exception ex)
           {
               logger.Error(ex, "Application stopped due to an exception.");
               throw;
           }
           finally
           {
               NLog.LogManager.Shutdown();  // Ensure NLog resources are released
           }
       }
   }
   ```

### 4. **Add NLog Web Dependencies**
   Ensure `NLog.Web.AspNetCore` is used in the project by adding this reference to your `Program.cs` as shown in the previous step. This helps NLog handle request-related logs and ASP.NET-specific contexts.

### 5. **Add Logging to Your Application**
   You can now inject and use the `ILogger<T>` interface wherever you need logging, like in your **Controllers** or **Services**. For example:

   ```csharp
   using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
   using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;

   [ApiController]
   [Route("api/[controller]")]
   public class SampleController : ControllerBase
   {
       private readonly ILogger<SampleController> _logger;

       public SampleController(ILogger<SampleController> logger)
       {
           _logger = logger;
       }

       [HttpGet]
       public IActionResult Get()
       {
           _logger.LogInformation("Sample GET request processed.");
           return Ok(new { Message = "Success" });
       }
   }
   ```

### 6. **Testing Your Logging**
   - Run your application and ensure the logs are written as per your `nlog.config` setup:
     - Log files should be created in the `logs` folder.
     - Log messages should also appear in the **console**.
   
### 7. **Advanced Configurations (Optional)**
   - **Different log levels**: You can change the `minlevel` attribute in the `nlog.config` to adjust the logging levels for different parts of your application (e.g., Debug, Info, Error).
   - **Database logging**: You can add a database target by configuring it in `nlog.config` using the `<target>` tag for database logging.
   - **Asynchronous logging**: Use `async="true"` in your NLog target configuration to improve performance by logging asynchronously.

### 8. **Deploy and Monitor Logs**
   - Once configured, ensure your deployment environments (Dev, Prod) have appropriate access to log file directories.
   - You can monitor logs for errors, information, and warnings as per your application’s logging level settings.

---

With this setup, you should now have **NLog** fully integrated with your **.NET Core 8.0** solution, providing robust logging capabilities to track and troubleshoot issues effectively.
